Computational Photography
=========================

Here you will learn different OpenCV functionalities related to Computational Photography like image denoising etc.

* :ref:`Image Denoising <doxid-d5/d69/tutorial_py_non_local_means>`
  
  See a good technique to remove noises in images called Non-Local Means Denoising

* :ref:`Image Inpainting <doxid-df/d3d/tutorial_py_inpainting>`
  
  Do you have a old degraded photo with many black spots and strokes on it? Take it. Let's try to restore them with a technique called image inpainting.

* :ref:`High Dynamic Range (HDR) <doxid-d2/df0/tutorial_py_hdr>`
  
  Learn how to merge exposure sequence and process high dynamic range images.
