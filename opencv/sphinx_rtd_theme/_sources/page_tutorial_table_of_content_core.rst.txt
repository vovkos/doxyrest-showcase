The Core Functionality (core module)
====================================

Here you will learn the about the basic building blocks of the library. A must read and know for understanding how to manipulate the images on a pixel level.

* :ref:`Mat - The Basic Image Container <doxid-d6/d6d/tutorial_mat_the_basic_image_container>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Bernát Gábor
  
  You will learn how to store images in the memory and how to print out their content to the console.

* :ref:`How to scan images, lookup tables and time measurement with OpenCV <doxid-db/da5/tutorial_how_to_scan_images>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Bernát Gábor
  
  You'll find out how to scan images (go through each of the image pixels) with OpenCV. Bonus: time measurement with OpenCV.

* :ref:`Mask operations on matrices <doxid-d7/d37/tutorial_mat_mask_operations>`
  
  *Languages:* C++, Java, Python
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Bernát Gábor
  
  You'll find out how to scan images with neighbor access and use the :ref:`cv::filter2D <doxid-d4/d86/group__imgproc__filter_1ga27c049795ce870216ddfb366086b5a04>` function to apply kernel filters on images.

* :ref:`Operations with images <doxid-d5/d98/tutorial_mat_operations>`
  
  Reading/writing images from file, accessing pixels, primitive operations, visualizing images.

* :ref:`Adding (blending) two images using OpenCV <doxid-d5/dc4/tutorial_adding_images>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  We will learn how to blend two images!

* :ref:`Changing the contrast and brightness of an image! <doxid-d3/dc1/tutorial_basic_linear_transform>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  We will learn how to change our image appearance!

* :ref:`Basic Drawing <doxid-d3/d96/tutorial_basic_geometric_drawing>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  We will learn how to draw simple geometry with OpenCV!

* :ref:`Random generator and text with OpenCV <doxid-df/d61/tutorial_random_generator_and_text>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  We will draw some *fancy-looking* stuff using OpenCV!

* :ref:`Discrete Fourier Transform <doxid-d8/d01/tutorial_discrete_fourier_transform>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Bernát Gábor
  
  You will see how and why use the Discrete Fourier transformation with OpenCV.

* :ref:`File Input and Output using XML and YAML files <doxid-dd/d74/tutorial_file_input_output_with_xml_yml>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Bernát Gábor
  
  You will see how to use the :ref:`cv::FileStorage <doxid-d9/df9/classcv_1_1_file_storage>` data structure of OpenCV to write and read data to XML or YAML file format.

* :ref:`Interoperability with OpenCV 1 <doxid-dd/d90/tutorial_interoperability_with__open_c_v_1>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Bernát Gábor
  
  Did you used OpenCV before its 2.0 version? Do you wanna know what happened with your library with 2.0? Don't you know how to convert your old OpenCV programs to the new C++ interface? Look here to shed light on all this questions.

* :ref:`Intel® IPP Asynchronous C/C++ library in OpenCV <doxid-dc/d0e/tutorial_how_to_use_ippa_conversion>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Elena Gvozdeva
  
  You will see how to use the IPP Async with OpenCV.

* :ref:`How to use the OpenCV parallel_for\_ to parallelize your code <doxid-de/d33/tutorial_how_to_use__open_c_v_parallel_for_>`
  
  *Compatibility:*>= OpenCV 2.4.3
  
  You will see how to use the OpenCV parallel_for\_ to easily parallelize your code.
