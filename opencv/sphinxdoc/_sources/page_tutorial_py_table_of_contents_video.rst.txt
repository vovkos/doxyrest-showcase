Video Analysis
==============

* :ref:`Meanshift and Camshift <doxid-db/df8/tutorial_py_meanshift>`
  
  We have already seen an example of color-based tracking. It is simpler. This time, we see significantly better algorithms like "Meanshift", and its upgraded version, "Camshift" to find and track them.

* :ref:`Optical Flow <doxid-d7/d8b/tutorial_py_lucas_kanade>`
  
  Now let's discuss an important concept, "Optical Flow", which is related to videos and has many applications.

* :ref:`Background Subtraction <doxid-db/d5c/tutorial_py_bg_subtraction>`
  
  In several applications, we need to extract foreground for further operations like object tracking. Background Subtraction is a well-known method in those cases.
