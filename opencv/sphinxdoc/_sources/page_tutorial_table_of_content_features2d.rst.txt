2D Features framework (feature2d module)
========================================

Learn about how to use the feature points detectors, descriptors and matching framework found inside OpenCV.

* :ref:`Harris corner detector <doxid-d4/d7d/tutorial_harris_detector>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  Why is it a good idea to track corners? We learn to use the Harris method to detect corners

* :ref:`Shi-Tomasi corner detector <doxid-d8/dd8/tutorial_good_features_to_track>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  Where we use an improved method to detect corners more accuratelyI

* :ref:`Creating yor own corner detector <doxid-d9/dbc/tutorial_generic_corner_detector>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  Here you will learn how to use OpenCV functions to make your personalized corner detector!

* :ref:`Detecting corners location in subpixeles <doxid-d8/d5e/tutorial_corner_subpixeles>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  Is pixel resolution enough? Here we learn a simple method to improve our accuracy.

* :ref:`Feature Detection <doxid-d7/d66/tutorial_feature_detection>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  In this tutorial, you will use *features2d* to detect interest points.

* :ref:`Feature Description <doxid-d5/dde/tutorial_feature_description>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  In this tutorial, you will use *features2d* to calculate feature vectors.

* :ref:`Feature Matching with FLANN <doxid-d5/d6f/tutorial_feature_flann_matcher>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  In this tutorial, you will use the FLANN library to make a fast matching.

  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Ana Huamán
  
  In this tutorial, you will use *features2d* and *calib3d* to detect an object in a scene.

* :ref:`Detection of planar objects <doxid-dd/dd4/tutorial_detection_of_planar_objects>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 2.0
  
  *Author:* Victor Eruhimov
  
  You will use *features2d* and *calib3d* modules for detecting known planar objects in scenes.

* :ref:`AKAZE local features matching <doxid-db/d70/tutorial_akaze_matching>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 3.0
  
  *Author:* Fedor Morozov
  
  Using *AKAZE* local features to find correspondence between two images.

* :ref:`AKAZE and ORB planar tracking <doxid-dc/d16/tutorial_akaze_tracking>`
  
  *Compatibility:*> OpenCV 3.0
  
  *Author:* Fedor Morozov
